# 📺 Netflix Data Visualization Project

This project analyzes and visualizes data from Netflix to uncover key trends related to content types, durations, ratings, release timelines, and country-wise contributions. Leveraging Python and popular visualization libraries, I created a series of insightful plots to explore how Netflix content has evolved over the years.
